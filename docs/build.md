# Build

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (Desktop development with C++) + Windows 11 SDK
- CMake, Ninja optional
- `adb` on PATH (Android platform-tools)
- `flatc` on PATH (winget `Google.flatbuffers`) -- used for FlatBuffers codegen from
  `proto/wire.fbs` and `proto/control.fbs` on both sides (see below)
- JDK 21, Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME`) for the Gradle build
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` -- pulls in `third_party/reference/VCamSample`
  and `third_party/flatbuffers` (the C++/Java FlatBuffers runtime, vendored because `flatc`'s
  installed version is newer than any published `flatbuffers-java` Maven artifact -- see
  `docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 4 section for why)

## Windows: host + common + svc (CMake)

```
cmake --build D:\work\phonecam\windows\build --target phonecam-host --config Debug
```

Other targets: `phonecam_common`, `phonecam-svc`. The control-protocol FlatBuffers headers
(`wire_generated.h`, `control_generated.h`) are generated automatically as part of the
`phonecam-host` build via a CMake custom command (`windows/host/CMakeLists.txt`) -- no manual
`flatc` invocation needed.

## Windows: vcam (MSBuild, not CMake)

`windows/vcam` is forked from VCamSample and needs the WIL/CppWinRT NuGet packages CMake doesn't
naturally consume, so it builds via its own MSBuild project:

```
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" `
  D:\work\phonecam\windows\vcam\PhoneCamVCam.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

**Deploying a vcam change:** the registered DLL
(`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{d0255f4e-4471-47c4-91fc-0e74dcc93308}\InprocServer32`) points at
`C:\ProgramData\PhoneCam\phonecam-vcam.dll`, a separate deployed copy -- **not** the MSBuild
output. Rebuilding alone does nothing until that copy is refreshed too:

1. Rebuild via the MSBuild command above.
2. Stop any running `phonecam-host.exe`.
3. Restart both the `FrameServer` and `FrameServerMonitor` Windows services (elevated).
4. Copy the rebuilt DLL over `C:\ProgramData\PhoneCam\phonecam-vcam.dll` (locked until step 2-3
   release it).
5. Relaunch `phonecam-host.exe`.

This whole dance is a known Phase 5 cleanup item (either always deploy from one source of truth,
or have the dev build target write directly to the registered path).

## Android

```
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

**Use PowerShell, not Bash**, for `gradlew.bat` in this environment -- a session hook redirects
Bash's `gradlew` invocations to a broken sandbox path missing `gradle-wrapper.jar` access.

The Kotlin FlatBuffers bindings are generated automatically as part of the build (a Gradle `Exec`
task in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` invoking `flatc --kotlin`) -- no manual step needed.

## Verifying the virtual camera reaches DirectShow apps, not just Media Foundation ones

```
ffmpeg -f dshow -list_devices true -i dummy   # confirm the registered name
ffmpeg -f dshow -i "video=PhoneCam (Windows Virtual Camera)" -frames:v 1 out.png
```

The DirectShow name has " (Windows Virtual Camera)" appended -- `"PhoneCam"` alone won't match.
This is the discriminating check established in Phase 1: Zoom/OBS-classic use DirectShow, and
"works in Windows Camera" alone doesn't prove the MF→DirectShow Frame Server bridge is intact.
