# Build

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (Desktop development with C++) + Windows 11 SDK
- CMake, Ninja optional
- `adb` on PATH (Android platform-tools)
- `flatc` on PATH (winget `Google.flatbuffers`) -- used for FlatBuffers codegen from
  `proto/wire.fbs` and `proto/control.fbs` on both sides (see below)
- JDK 21, Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME`) for the Gradle build
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` -- pulls in `third_party/reference/VCamSample`
  and `third_party/flatbuffers` (the C++/Java FlatBuffers runtime, vendored because `flatc`'s
  installed version is newer than any published `flatbuffers-java` Maven artifact -- see
  `docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 4 section for why)
- Inno Setup (winget `JRSoftware.InnoSetup`) -- only needed to build the installer
  (`windows/installer/PhoneCam.iss`), not for day-to-day dev builds. Installs to
  `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe`, not on PATH by default.

## Windows: host + common + svc (CMake)

```
cmake --build D:\work\phonecam\windows\build --target phonecam-host --config Debug
```

Other targets: `phonecam_common`, `phonecam-svc`. The control-protocol FlatBuffers headers
(`wire_generated.h`, `control_generated.h`) are generated automatically as part of the
`phonecam-host` build via a CMake custom command (`windows/host/CMakeLists.txt`) -- no manual
`flatc` invocation needed.

## Windows: vcam (MSBuild, not CMake)

`windows/vcam` is forked from VCamSample and needs the WIL/CppWinRT NuGet packages CMake doesn't
naturally consume, so it builds via its own MSBuild project:

```
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" `
  D:\work\phonecam\windows\vcam\PhoneCamVCam.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

**Deploying a vcam change:** the registered DLL
(`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{d0255f4e-4471-47c4-91fc-0e74dcc93308}\InprocServer32`) points at
`C:\ProgramData\PhoneCam\phonecam-vcam.dll`, a separate deployed copy -- **not** the MSBuild
output. `PhoneCamVCam.vcxproj` now has a `PostBuildEvent` (Phase 5) that copies `$(TargetPath)`
over that ProgramData copy automatically on every build, best-effort (it silently no-ops if the
file is locked). So the remaining steps after a rebuild are just:

1. Rebuild via the MSBuild command above (the ProgramData copy refreshes automatically, unless
   locked -- see step 2-3 below).
2. Stop any running `phonecam-host.exe`.
3. If the PostBuildEvent's copy was skipped because the DLL was locked, restart both the
   `FrameServer` and `FrameServerMonitor` Windows services (elevated) to release it, then rebuild
   again.
4. Relaunch `phonecam-host.exe`.

## Windows: installer (Inno Setup)

The installer packages **Release** builds (static CRT, no VC++ redistributable dependency -- see
`docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 5 section), not the Debug builds the commands above produce:

```
cmake --build D:\work\phonecam\windows\build --target phonecam-host --config Release
cmake --build D:\work\phonecam\windows\build --target phonecam-svc --config Release
& "...\MSBuild.exe" D:\work\phonecam\windows\vcam\PhoneCamVCam.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
& "$env:LocalAppData\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" D:\work\phonecam\windows\installer\PhoneCam.iss
```

Output: `windows\installer\Output\PhoneCamSetup.exe`. It bundles `adb.exe` (from
`third_party/platform-tools/`, vendored -- not resolved from PATH), so `phonecam-host.exe` works
standalone once installed, no PATH setup needed. Installing/uninstalling both require admin (the
installer requests elevation itself) since they touch `HKLM`, `ProgramData`, and the Windows
service.

**Verified on this machine, not on a fresh Windows account** (that's the installer's actual
roadmap exit criterion, and isn't verifiable here) -- see `docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 5
section for exactly what was and wasn't checked.

## Android

```
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

**Use PowerShell, not Bash**, for `gradlew.bat` in this environment -- a session hook redirects
Bash's `gradlew` invocations to a broken sandbox path missing `gradle-wrapper.jar` access.

The Kotlin FlatBuffers bindings are generated automatically as part of the build (a Gradle `Exec`
task in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` invoking `flatc --kotlin`) -- no manual step needed.

## Verifying the virtual camera reaches DirectShow apps, not just Media Foundation ones

```
ffmpeg -f dshow -list_devices true -i dummy   # confirm the registered name
ffmpeg -f dshow -i "video=PhoneCam (Windows Virtual Camera)" -frames:v 1 out.png
```

The DirectShow name has " (Windows Virtual Camera)" appended -- `"PhoneCam"` alone won't match.
This is the discriminating check established in Phase 1: Zoom/OBS-classic use DirectShow, and
"works in Windows Camera" alone doesn't prove the MF→DirectShow Frame Server bridge is intact.
