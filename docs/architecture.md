# Architecture

High-level map of the system and the state of each piece. For wire-level
detail see [`wire-protocol.md`](wire-protocol.md) and
[`control-protocol.md`](control-protocol.md).

## Overview

```
[Android APK]  Camera2 → MediaCodec H.264 (low-latency, zero-copy Surface)
                       │            (+ AudioRecord → Opus, Phase 8)
                       ▼
[USB transport]  MVP: ADB-forward socket   →   Phase 7: AOA (no USB-debugging)
                       ▼
[phonecam-host.exe]  MF H.264 decode → SharedFrameRing (shared memory)
                       ▼
[phonecam-vcam.dll]  MFCreateVirtualCamera media source → seen by ALL apps
                       ▲
[control channel]  bidirectional: PC → phone commands, phone → PC capabilities/telemetry
```

The phone captures and hardware-encodes video, streams it over USB, and
`phonecam-host.exe` decodes it and writes NV12 frames into a cross-process
shared-memory ring. `phonecam-vcam.dll` — a Media Foundation virtual camera
media source registered via `MFCreateVirtualCamera` — reads that ring and
serves frames to whichever app (or Windows service) has it open. Windows'
Frame Server bridges the same registered source to both Media Foundation
consumers (Chrome, Windows Camera, new Teams) and DirectShow consumers (Zoom,
classic OBS) — this is what makes "a real camera in every app" true rather
than an OBS-only plugin.

## Components

| Component | Build system | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `android/` | Gradle (Kotlin) | The installed phone app: capture, encode, transport, control, foreground service. Not yet started (Phase 2). |
| `windows/common/` | CMake, static lib | Shared code between host and... conceptually vcam too, but see note below. Currently: `log/` (cross-process logging via stderr + `OutputDebugString`) and `shm/SharedFrameRing.h` (the frame-handoff contract). |
| `windows/host/` | CMake → `phonecam-host.exe` | `vcam_ctl/` calls `MFCreateVirtualCamera`/`Start`/`Remove`. `bridge/TestPatternProducer` is a Phase-1b dev tool standing in for the real H.264-decode bridge that Phase 3 adds. |
| `windows/vcam/` | **own MSBuild project** (`PhoneCamVCam.sln`/`.vcxproj`), not CMake | Forked from [VCamSample](https://github.com/smourier/VCamSample) (MIT) — see [`NOTICE.md`](../windows/vcam/NOTICE.md). The `IMFMediaSourceEx` COM media source. `FrameGenerator::Generate()` now reads the latest frame from `SharedFrameRing` (NV12→RGB32, blitted via the existing D2D1 render target) instead of the sample's built-in test pattern — everything else (D3D/CPU dual-path handling, NV12/RGB32 output, sample construction) is untouched. |
| `third_party/reference/VCamSample` | git submodule | Unmodified upstream, kept for comparison. |

**Why `vcam/` isn't a CMake target:** it needs NuGet-distributed WIL and
CppWinRT, which CMake doesn't naturally consume, and it's proven to build via
its own MSBuild project as-is. Since `phonecam-host` and `phonecam-vcam.dll`
are separate processes that talk *only* through `SharedFrameRing.h` (a
header-only contract both include directly), the two build systems never need
to interoperate. See `windows/CMakeLists.txt` for the build command.

## Status: Phase 1 complete (vertical slice proven)

Both checkpoints of the highest-risk item in the whole project — does a frame
actually reach a virtual camera that real apps render, through **both** the
Media Foundation and DirectShow paths — are done, with captured evidence:

- **Phase 1a** (stock, unmodified VCamSample, relocated and re-registered
  under our own CLSID): confirmed via a captured DirectShow frame
  (`ffmpeg -f dshow`) showing the sample's built-in gradient/text test
  pattern rendered as `Format: NV12 (CPU)`.
- **Phase 1b** (our fork, `FrameGenerator` reading from `SharedFrameRing`
  instead of drawing its own pattern; `phonecam-host` writing a synthetic
  animated frame via `TestPatternProducer`): confirmed via a captured
  DirectShow frame showing our host's actual scrolling-bar pattern, proving
  the full chain — host write → shared memory → vcam read → NV12→RGB32 →
  D2D1 → MF sample → Frame Server → DirectShow consumer.

Next: Phase 2 (Android capture) and Phase 3 (USB transport, replacing
`TestPatternProducer` with the real H.264-decode bridge).

## Open design question this phase surfaced: elevation

`SharedFrameRing` must live in the `Global\` kernel-object namespace with an
SDDL granting access to `LocalService`/`LocalSystem` (not just the current
user) — this is required because Windows 11's Frame Server / Frame Server
Monitor services load `phonecam-vcam.dll` **in-process into themselves**,
running as `LocalService`/`LocalSystem` in **Session 0**, a different session
than the interactive host process. `Local\` (session-relative) objects are
invisible there, and the default DACL on an object created by the interactive
user doesn't grant those service SIDs access either.

**Creating a `Global\` object with a broadened (cross-session) DACL requires
`SeCreateGlobalPrivilege` — confirmed empirically:** the identical
`CreateFileMappingW` call with our SDDL returns `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` (5) from
a normal (non-elevated) process, even for an administrator account, because
UAC token-filtering disables that privilege until elevated; the same call
succeeds (`SeCreateGlobalPrivilege: Enabled`) once elevated. The *read* side
(`SharedFrameRing::Open()`, used by `phonecam-vcam.dll` wherever it's loaded)
needs no special privilege — only the *create* side (`OpenOrCreate()`, called
by `phonecam-host`) does.

This means **`phonecam-host` cannot create the ring while running as a normal
(non-elevated) interactive process.** Options, not yet decided:

1. **Run `phonecam-host` elevated always.** Simplest, but a real recurring
   UX cost (a permanent UAC-elevated background app) that competitors
   (DroidCam, Iriun, Camo) don't impose on their PC apps.
2. **Move ring ownership into a Windows Service running as LocalSystem**
   (which has `SeCreateGlobalPrivilege` inherently), with the interactive
   parts (tray icon, UI, USB transport if it needs user-session access)
   as a separate unprivileged process talking to the service. This is a
   natural fit with the Phase 5 "tray app" plan already, not a new direction
   — but it is more architecture than a single `.exe`.
3. ~~Narrow the SDDL to avoid needing the privilege~~ — not viable: the whole
   reason for the broad grant is the Frame Server's cross-session access,
   which is exactly what triggers the requirement.

**Decision pending** — raise with the user before Phase 3 locks in the host
process model, since it affects the installer (Phase 5) and how "always
running" is achieved.
